# Greenhouse Control System

## Project Overview
This project involves creating an automated control system for a greenhouse, using ESP32 microcontrollers, IR lamps, DHT11 sensors, and relays for environmental monitoring and control. The goal is to have these systems in different spots in the greenhouse to avoid freezing temp on the ceiling and also melting the snow. In future we want to connect all together and maybe a system outside to also predict the freezing temp and over rules and start the IR and fans early.

## Features
- Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring.
- Web interface for manual and automatic control of IR lamps and fans. 'chart.php'
- BLE integration for inter-device communication in future.
- Data logging with PHP and MySQL. 'data_logger.php'

## Setup and Installation
Provide detailed instructions on how to set up the project:
- Hardware setup.
- Software dependencies.
- Installation steps.

## Usage
Explain how to use the system, including how to interact with the web interface and how the BLE functionality works.

## Contributing
Guidelines for others who want to contribute to the project.

## License
Specify the license under which the project is released.
